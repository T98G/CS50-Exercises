sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: it takes a lot less time for it to sort the sorted50000 than it takes for it to sort the reversed50000 file, but it's still slower than programs 2 and 3 and the slowest program to sort the reversed50000 file

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: it's the fastest program and takes almost the same amount of time for it sort the reversed50000 file and sorted

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: it takes aproximately the same amount of time for it to sort the reversed50000 and the sorted50000 files. It's slower than program 2 but faster than program 1 in sorting the reversed50000 file
